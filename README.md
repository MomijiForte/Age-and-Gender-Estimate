**NOTE**

UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. The labels of each image are embedded in the file name, formatted as [age] [gender] [race] [date&time].jpg.
